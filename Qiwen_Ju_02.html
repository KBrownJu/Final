			<span>As a student who majors in design, I like reading numerous materials online to get inspired. However, when viewing web pages that contain more information, I tend to focus more on the number of words instead of the content.<br/><br/>Therefore, in the process of creating and developing web pages, I prefer to present all web pages through one page in order to allow viewers to easily locate the resources they need.<br/><br/>In my first project, I simply choose white as the overall background color rather than use a combination of various colors. I also divided the page into four columns where the second chapter of the original article is inserted in order. All titles are marked in bold, so that viewers can find what they are interested as soon as they open the website.<br/><br/>For the typeface, I pick the Montserrat and Arial. Designed by Google, Montserrat is a typeface that is wider than Arial, so it is used as the font for all titles which need to be eye-catching and concise. Arial is used as the second option for text as it is also easy to read.<br/>
